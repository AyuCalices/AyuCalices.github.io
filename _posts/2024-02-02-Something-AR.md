The game is a mixed-reality experience using the Meta Quest headset. It transforms your living room into an interactive arena, blending the real world with a virtual forest. Players collaborate or compete to catch mischievous creatures invading their space. The game combines immersive VR elements with multiplayer functionality, encouraging teamwork and friendly rivalry.
