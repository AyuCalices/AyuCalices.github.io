<br> Time/Effort: 10 months part time

## Project Details
The aim of the VENTUS project is to develop a flexible and cost-effective system for the exchange and interactive visualization of 3D data and to publish it as an open source application. The visualization is made possible with head-mounted displays from various manufacturers as well as standard screens. To support collaboration, various interaction techniques such as pointing, gestures and the creation of annotations, 3D-sketching and CAD-models were implemented. The exchange of extensive model data between collaboration partners is simple and efficient. The system is geared towards business and product development processes in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

## My Core Responsibillities
* Designed user interfaces focusing on usability.
* Defined user scenarios and feature specifications.
* Interaction System working for both Desktop and VR
* Implemented robust mechanisms for Redo/Undo across tasks.
* Designed systems for collaboration and real-time data exchange.
