## Game Details
A simple frontend for chat and storywriting, powered by AI-driven Image and Text Generators. It integrates the Stable Diffusion and Oobabooga APIs to provide a highly customizable AI experience. Stable Diffusion is an image generator that enables players to create images for their chats and stories, while Oobabooga is a text generation API that provides chatting with characters or storytelling. Users can interact with and fine-tune AI models, offering various ways to adjust the settings to suit their needs. The platform supports both remote and local connections to APIs such as Stable Diffusion and Oobabooga, giving users full control over their setup for a more personalized experience.

The Book Selection Screen is the central hub of the application where users can manage and interact with their AI-generated books. Once the necessary models are loaded from the APIs, this screen presents users with a library view of all their saved books, allowing them to easily choose and continue their interactions.

The Book Creation Screen is where users can customize and set up the parameters for a new book. This is the stage where users define the core elements of their book, whether they are creating a conversation with an AI character or generating a narrated story.

The Book Chatting Screen is the interactive space where users engage in real-time conversations or continue the narrative within their created books. Once a book has been set up with its characters and parameters, this screen becomes the main area for communication with the AI.
