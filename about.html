  <h1> Who Am I? </h1>
  <p>I was born 25 years ago. There aren't many memories when looking 15 years back. The thing I know for sure is my passion for video games although I can't remember when it began.
  But one of the few memories I can recall quite well is myself passionately creating some leveling sheets for a lego game with my friends.
  Today I find it quite funny that all those papers I created could be done with just one line of code and some math.</p>

  <p>Since I was always creative I expressed that in my early days with art and design. As time passed I noticed that art and design wasn't quite the path I wanted to follow.
  When I graduated my vocational training in product design I completed that chapter. This was the bridge to the missing pieces I was looking for when I started my studies at
  the HTW Berlin in Media and Computing: I found out, that I like beeing creative in solving logical programming puzzles. Especially when it comes to creating games.</p>

  <p>In 2022 I graduated with a bachelors degree at the HTW Berlin in Media and Computing with the specialisation on Game Technology & Interactive Systems.
  Currently I am undergraduate master student in the same course of study.</p>
