      <a>I was born 25 years ago, and when I look back 15 years, there aren't many memories. However, one thing I do remember is my passion for video games, although I can't recall when it began.
      One of the few memories I can recall quite well is myself passionately creating some leveling sheets for a lego game with my friends.
      Today I find it quite amusing that all those papers I created could be done with just one line of code and some math.</a>
      <p>Since I was always creative I expressed that in my early days with art and design. As time passed I noticed that art and design wasn't quite the path I wanted to follow.
      When I graduated my vocational training in product design I completed that chapter. This was the bridge to the missing pieces I was looking for, when I started my studies at
      the HTW Berlin in Media and Computing: I found out that I like being creative in solving logical programming puzzles. Especially when it comes to creating games.</p>

  <p>In 2022 I graduated with a bachelors degree at the HTW Berlin in Media and Computing with the specialization  on Game Technology & Interactive Systems.
  Currently I am an undergraduate master student in the same course of study.</p>
